##### Hour

The hour notation is two times 12 hours. The first twelve hours are the values 0-11 (base 10), while the last 
12 hours have a dot inside the number.

##### Minute

The minute notation increases the value every five minutes. Every minute a dot is added. First on top, then on
the right, then on the bottom and finally on the left.
